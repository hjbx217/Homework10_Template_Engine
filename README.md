# Homework10_Template_Engine

Built a command line application that was supposed to generate a software engineering team generator. 

This application prompts the user with the correct questions for the type of employee depending on their initial selection. * Use the [Inquirer npm package](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.

The application will prompt the user for any information about the team members. All unit tests pass, and the application should ultimately create an HTML file.
